      description: "This study sought to understand school leaders' views of literacy education from a European perspective. Eight Norwegian primary school's literacy plans were randomly selected, and one EU policy document, the final report by the EU High-Level Group of Experts on Literacy, was chosen purposefully. A detailed thematic analysis of the expert group's report was the basis for a content analysis of the literacy plans. The result was interpreted using John McNeils' four curriculum ideologies. The analysis suggested that both had a small preference for the humanistic curriculum, illustrated by their emphasis on motivation, individualization, and qualitative assessment. However, the plans and the report included learning-objectives and standardized assessments, elements associated with a systemic view of education. Further, they also expressed views consistent with the academic and social reconstructionist curriculum. Overall, the study revealed the High-Level Group Experts on Literacy and the Norwegian primary school leaders' view on literacy education was multifaceted but similar.",
